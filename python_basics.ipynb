        "\n",
        "  -Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility.  It's designed to be easy to learn and use, and it's capable of handling a wide range of tasks.  Its popularity stems from several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Readability: Python's syntax is clear and intuitive, resembling plain English. This makes it easier to learn, write, and understand code, which leads to increased developer productivity.  The \"Zen of Python\" (a collection of guiding principles for Python design) explicitly emphasizes readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Versatility: Python is used in a vast array of applications, including:Web Development,Data Science and Machine Learning,Scripting and Automation,Scientific Computing,etc\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code.\n",
        "  Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "  You write Python code in a file (like a .py file) or directly in an interactive environment like a Google Colab notebook cell.\n",
        "  The interpreter reads your code line by line.\n",
        "  For each line, the interpreter converts the code into instructions that the computer's processor can understand (this is often called bytecode).\n",
        "  The interpreter then executes those instructions.\n",
        "  This process continues until all of your code has been read and executed.\n",
        "  Why is this important?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Because of the interpreter, you don't have to compile your Python code into a separate executable file before running it. The interpreter allows for a more interactive and immediate way to write and test code.\n",

        "Q3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -In Python, pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings. They are part of the Python language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Reserved Words: These keywords are reserved for specific purposes within the Python language. You cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, or other objects in your code.\n",
        "  \n",

Using a keyword as a variable name would create confusion for the interpreter, as it wouldn't be able to distinguish between the keyword's intended meaning and its use as a variable. This would lead to a syntax error.\n",

As a result, trying to modify a tuple element would require creating a new tuple with the modified value, leaving the original tuple unchanged.\n",
        "Key differences and reasons for immutability:\n",
